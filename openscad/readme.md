# OpenScad PCB holder generator

## Note
You may need to adjust the first instance of `$fn100;` for more facets on your pcb edge cuts.
You should probably use nightly OpenScad for multi threaded rendering.
You may need to adjust the tolerances based on material choices, and printer capabilities.

To use this, simply replace the `pcb_holder.dxf` file with your board edge cuts as a dxf.
